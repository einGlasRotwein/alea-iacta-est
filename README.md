"Enchanting" a die in order to get higher outcomes via regression to the mean.

## included so far
* .csv file including 200 real world "enchanted" die rolls
* an .Rmd notebook (source and .html) containing
  * a description of the project and how the enchantment worked
  * reading in and preparing the real world data for analysis
  * visualisation of the data showing that I can enchant a die
  * a function for randomly generating "enchanted" die rolls

## featuring
* some simple usages of `base R` and the `tidyverse`, including plots, of course
* (to be included) basic inferential statistics
* (to be included) using self-written functions in `R`
* (to be included) explaining regression to the mean

## to be included
* an analysis of the data showing
  * that the die can be seemingly "enchanted" in order to achieve better outcomes compared to the roll before
  * that this "improvement" is due to a regression to the mean
  * that the distribution of the die rolls is still uniform
* a fancier way of presenting the thing
  * branch gitbook, current status: wtf, but getting there
