"Enchanting" a die in order to get higher outcomes via regression to the mean.

## toying around
For now, I will use this tiny project to get used to the Git workflow. Adding data files, editing code and how to make stuff usable for others.

## to be included
* the story of the enchanted die
* description of the "enchantment procedure"
* data of 200 real world die rolls
* an R-Script including
  * (a function for) randomly generated die rolls
  * an analysis of the data showing
    * that the die can be seemingly "enchanted" in order to achieve better outcomes compared to the roll before
    * that this "improvement" is due to a regression to the mean
    * that the distribution of the die rolls is still uniform
